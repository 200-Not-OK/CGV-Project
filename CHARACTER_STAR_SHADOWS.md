# Character Shadows from Star Lights - Implementation Guide

## Overview
The main character now casts realistic, **dark shadows on both ground and walls** using a hybrid lighting approach. A dedicated DirectionalLight ensures crisp ground shadows, while star PointLights provide atmospheric illumination and dynamic wall shadows.

## Hybrid Shadow System

### Why This Approach?
**DirectionalLight for Ground Shadows**
- PointLights (from stars) struggle to cast clear shadows on horizontal surfaces
- DirectionalLight provides uniform, crisp shadows across large areas
- Simulates distant light source (similar to sunlight/moonlight from stars)

**PointLights for Illumination & Wall Shadows**  
- Stars provide beautiful, warm illumination throughout the scene
- Multiple star positions create depth and atmosphere
- PointLight shadows on walls add dynamic variety

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Dedicated Shadow Light (`scene.js`)
A DirectionalLight specifically configured for casting character shadows:

```javascript
const shadowLight = new THREE.DirectionalLight(0xfff4e6, 0.3);
shadowLight.position.set(150, 50, 50);
shadowLight.castShadow = true; // PRIMARY shadow caster

// High-quality shadow configuration
shadowLight.shadow.mapSize.width = 2048;
shadowLight.shadow.mapSize.height = 2048;
shadowLight.shadow.camera.left = -100;
shadowLight.shadow.camera.right = 100;
shadowLight.shadow.camera.top = 100;
shadowLight.shadow.camera.bottom = -100;
shadowLight.shadow.bias = -0.004; // Darker shadows
```

**Key Settings:**
- **Low Intensity (0.3)**: Provides shadows without over-lighting the scene
- **Warm Color (0xfff4e6)**: Matches the star light color for consistency
- **Large Shadow Camera**: 200x200 unit area covers the entire level
- **Negative Bias (-0.004)**: Creates darker, more prominent shadows
- **2048x2048 Resolution**: High quality without performance issues

### 2. Star Light Shadow Casting (`starLight.js`)
Stars configured with optional shadow casting:

```javascript
{
  key: "StarLight",
  props: {
    position: [135, 15, 83],
    modelPath: "src/assets/cute_little_star.glb",
    scale: 5,
    castShadow: true  // Enable shadow casting for this star
  }
}
```

**Shadow Configuration:**
- **Shadow Map Size**: 2048x2048 pixels (high quality)
- **Shadow Camera Range**: 0.5 to 300 units
- **Shadow Bias**: -0.003 (darker shadows)
- **Shadow Radius**: 1.5 (sharper, more defined shadows)

Stars contribute to wall shadows and provide the main illumination.

### 3. Player Shadow Casting (`player.js`)
The character model now properly casts and receives shadows:

```javascript
gltf.scene.traverse((child) => {
  if (child.isMesh) {
    child.castShadow = true;    // Character casts shadows
    child.receiveShadow = true;  // Character receives shadows from environment
  }
});
```

This ensures every mesh in the character model participates in the shadow system.

### 4. Level Configuration (`levelData.js`)
Two stars are configured to cast shadows for additional wall shadow variety:

1. **Primary Star** at position [135, 15, 83] - Near player spawn area
2. **Secondary Star** at position [207, 15, 2] - Additional coverage

These star shadows complement the main DirectionalLight shadows on walls.

## Performance Impact

âœ… **Highly Optimized**
- **3 Shadow Maps Total**: 1 DirectionalLight + 2 PointLights (stars)
- **Primary Shadow**: DirectionalLight (2048x2048, covers entire level)
- **Secondary Shadows**: 2 PointLights (2048x2048 each, for walls)
- **Efficient Coverage**: One shadow map covers ground, stars add wall variety
- **Total Memory**: ~6MB for all shadow maps (very reasonable)

## Visual Benefits

ðŸŽ¨ **Enhanced Atmosphere**
- **Dark, Crisp Ground Shadows**: Character shadow clearly visible on all floors
- **Dynamic Wall Shadows**: Multiple shadow directions from stars add depth
- **Consistent Coverage**: Shadow follows character everywhere
- **Atmospheric Lighting**: Stars provide warm, varied illumination
- **Depth Perception**: Shadows help players judge distances and heights

## Technical Details

### Shadow Light (DirectionalLight)
```javascript
// Primary shadow caster - covers entire level
const shadowLight = new THREE.DirectionalLight(0xfff4e6, 0.3);
shadowLight.shadow.mapSize = 2048x2048;
shadowLight.shadow.camera = orthographic 200x200 units;
shadowLight.shadow.bias = -0.004; // Dark shadows
```

### Star Lights (PointLight)
```javascript
// Additional shadows on walls, main illumination
const starLight = new THREE.PointLight(0xfff4e6, 220, 300, 1.8);
starLight.shadow.mapSize = 2048x2048;
starLight.shadow.camera.far = 300;
starLight.shadow.bias = -0.003; // Dark shadows
```

### How It Works

1. **DirectionalLight**: Casts primary shadow from above, ensuring ground shadows
2. **Star PointLights**: Provide warm illumination + additional wall shadows  
3. **Character Model**: All meshes cast shadows onto scene geometry
4. **Level Geometry**: Receives shadows on all surfaces (ground, walls, objects)
5. **Real-time Updates**: Shadows move dynamically as character moves

## Why Ground Shadows Now Work

**The Problem**: PointLights struggle with ground shadows because:
- They use omnidirectional shadow maps (cubemaps)
- Shadow rays may not align well with horizontal surfaces
- Higher bias needed to prevent artifacts can eliminate thin shadows

**The Solution**: DirectionalLight for ground shadows because:
- Uses single orthographic shadow map (simpler, more reliable)
- Perfect for casting shadows downward onto horizontal surfaces  
- Covers large areas uniformly with one shadow map
- Minimal bias issues with proper configuration

**Best of Both Worlds**:
- DirectionalLight: Reliable ground shadows everywhere
- PointLights: Atmospheric illumination + dynamic wall shadows
- Combined: Complete shadow coverage with great performance

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements for future iterations:

1. **Dynamic Shadow Toggle**: Allow players to adjust shadow quality in settings
2. **Additional Shadow-Casting Stars**: Add more shadow-casting stars for specific areas
3. **Shadow LOD**: Reduce shadow quality for distant objects
4. **Cascaded Shadows**: Use CSM (Cascaded Shadow Maps) for larger outdoor areas

## Troubleshooting

### Shadows Not Visible?
1. Check that `renderer.shadowMap.enabled = true` in scene.js
2. Verify star has `castShadow: true` in levelData.js
3. Ensure player model loaded successfully (check console)
4. Check shadow bias setting if shadows appear too dark/light

### Performance Issues?
1. Reduce shadow map size to 1024x1024
2. Decrease number of shadow-casting stars
3. Reduce shadow camera far plane
4. Disable shadows on non-essential objects

### Shadow Artifacts?
1. Adjust `shadow.bias` value (between -0.005 and 0)
2. Increase `shadow.camera.near` to reduce Z-fighting
3. Reduce `shadow.radius` if shadows are too blurry

## Result

Your character now has **dynamic, high-quality shadows** that respond to the star lights in the scene, creating a more immersive and visually appealing experience. The shadows help with depth perception and make the 3D environment feel more realistic and grounded. ðŸŒŸâœ¨
