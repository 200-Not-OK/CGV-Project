# Character Shadow System - Simple & Effective

## What Was Fixed

Your character now has a **guaranteed, visible shadow** using a simple, performance-friendly approach.

### Single Shadow Light (`scene.js`)
One dedicated directional light casts shadows for the entire scene:

```javascript
const shadowLight = new THREE.DirectionalLight(0xaaaacc, 0.6);
shadowLight.castShadow = true;
shadowLight.shadow.mapSize.width = 2048;  // High quality
shadowLight.shadow.mapSize.height = 2048;
```

**Why This Works:**
- **Intensity 0.6** - Bright enough for clear, visible shadows
- **One light source** - No performance overhead from multiple shadow maps
- **Covers 240x240 area** - Large enough for your entire level
- **2048px resolution** - Crisp, clean shadows without being overkill

### Player Configuration (`player.js`)
```javascript
child.castShadow = true;   // Character casts shadows
child.receiveShadow = true; // Character receives shadows
```

## Performance Impact
âœ… **Minimal** - Single shadow-casting light
âœ… **Efficient** - DirectionalLight is optimized for large areas
âœ… **No conflicts** - Stars and flames provide lighting WITHOUT shadows

## How It Works
1. **Shadow Light** - Creates the character shadow (always visible)
2. **Ambient Light** - Prevents pure black areas (0.08 intensity)
3. **Star Lights** - Primary scene illumination (NO shadow casting)
4. **Flame Lights** - Localized warm lighting (NO shadow casting)

## Result
Your character will have a **clear, consistent shadow** at all times without any performance issues. Stars and flames provide beautiful lighting while the dedicated shadow light handles shadows efficiently.

That's it! Simple and effective. ðŸŽ®
