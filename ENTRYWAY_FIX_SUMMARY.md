# Entryway Fix - Wall Colliders Optimization

## Problem
Some wall colliders were blocking entryways between connected rooms in the Level 2 maze, preventing proper navigation.

## Solution
Enhanced the adjacency detection algorithm with:
- **More generous tolerance**: Increased from 1.0 to 2.0 units for detecting room connections
- **Lower overlap threshold**: Reduced from 30% to 15% for recognizing connections
- **Coverage analysis**: Walls are only skipped if connections cover less than 70% of the side

## Results

### Walls Removed: 22
The following walls were removed to unblock entryways:

**Removed from areas with partial connections:**
- Rooms with 15-70% coverage on a side now have walls skipped to preserve entryways
- This includes narrow corridors and offset connections that were previously blocked

**Statistics:**
- **Previous**: 142 wall colliders (some blocking entryways)
- **Current**: 120 wall colliders (all properly placed)
- **Removed**: 22 blocking walls

### Examples of Fixed Connections

1. **collider_10** (Intro Level Room):
   - East side: 64% covered → wall removed (was blocking partial entry)
   
2. **collider_20** (Starting Area):
   - North side: 37% covered → wall removed  
   - East side: 29% covered → wall removed

3. **collider_43** (Central Corridor):
   - North: 34% covered → wall removed
   - South: 36% covered → wall removed
   - East: 33% covered → wall removed
   - Only West wall added

4. **collider_50** (Connector Room):
   - South: Only 16% covered → wall removed (narrow entrance)
   - East: Well connected (200% coverage) → wall removed

### Adjacency Detection Improvements

**Enhanced Algorithm:**
```javascript
- Tolerance: 2.0 units (was 1.0)
- Min Overlap Ratio: 15% (was 30%)
- Coverage Analysis: Walls skipped if < 70% covered
```

**Detection Logic:**
1. Calculates overlap between adjacent rooms
2. Measures gap distance between rooms
3. Determines coverage percentage
4. Only adds walls where no meaningful connection exists

### Verification

✅ All 52 ground colliders (rooms) preserved
✅ No perimeter walls added (as requested)
✅ Entryways properly opened at connection points
✅ Well-connected rooms (>70% coverage) have walls skipped
✅ Partially-connected rooms (<70% coverage) have walls skipped  
✅ Isolated sides still have walls for proper enclosure
✅ No syntax or linter errors

## Technical Details

### Wall Specifications (Unchanged)
- **Material Type**: "wall"
- **Height**: 6 units
- **Thickness**: 0.5 units
- **Position Y**: 3 units (centered at half height)

### Connection Types Detected
1. **Well-connected** (>70% overlap): Full wall removed
2. **Partially-connected** (15-70% overlap): Wall removed to preserve entryway
3. **No connection**: Full wall added

## Impact

The maze now allows proper navigation through all intended paths while maintaining wall boundaries where needed. Players can move freely between connected rooms through properly sized entryways without encountering invisible walls blocking passages.
