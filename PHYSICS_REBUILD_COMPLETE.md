# Physics System Rebuild - Complete

## Overview

The entire physics and collision system has been rebuilt from scratch using **Cannon.js** as the physics engine. The player character can now properly stand and move on platforms and other meshes without falling through them.

## What Was Changed

### 1. **PhysicsWorld.js** - Complete Rewrite
- **New Cannon.js Integration**: Full rigid body dynamics with materials and contact resolution
- **Material System**: Ground, player, enemy materials with specific friction/restitution
- **Contact Materials**: Customized interactions between different material types
- **Debug Rendering**: Cannon-ES-Debugger integration for wireframe visualization
- **Optimized Settings**: SAP broadphase, 20 solver iterations, proper contact stiffness

### 2. **Player.js** - Physics-Based Movement
- **Physics Body Creation**: Dynamic body created after GLTF model loads to match dimensions
- **Hybrid Movement**: Direct velocity for grounded movement, forces for airborne movement
- **Ground Detection**: Contact normal analysis (`contact.ni.y > 0.5`) for reliable ground state
- **Model-First Approach**: Physics body dimensions calculated from loaded 3D model

### 3. **Game.js** - Physics Integration
- **Physics Step**: `physicsWorld.step(deltaTime)` in main game loop
- **Debug Controls**: 'G' key and `window.togglePhysicsDebug()` for visualization
- **Level Integration**: Automatic physics body generation for level geometry

### 4. **Level.js** - Static Collision Bodies
- **GLTF Physics**: All level meshes automatically get physics bodies
- **Fallback Geometry**: Procedural boxes also create corresponding physics bodies
- **Proper Cleanup**: Physics bodies removed when level is disposed

## Key Features

### ✅ **Solid Platform Collision**
- Players can stand and move on platforms without falling through
- Box colliders created from mesh bounding boxes
- Static physics bodies for all level geometry

### ✅ **Realistic Physics**
- Gravity, friction, and contact resolution
- No bouncing or jittery movement
- Stable ground detection

### ✅ **Performance Optimized**
- Sweep and Prune broadphase for many objects
- Proper material configurations
- Bodies can sleep when not moving

### ✅ **Debugging Tools**
- Visual physics wireframes with Cannon-ES-Debugger
- Console logging for movement and collision detection
- Toggle debug visualization with 'G' key

## Debug Commands

```javascript
// Toggle physics debug visualization
togglePhysicsDebug()

// Check debug status
physicsDebugStatus()

// Access physics world directly
window.__GAME__.physicsWorld
```

## Physics Configuration

### Materials & Contact Settings
- **Player-Ground**: High friction (0.8), no bounce (0.0)
- **Player-Platform**: Same as ground for consistent movement
- **Player-Wall**: Maximum friction (1.0) to prevent sliding
- **Enemy-Ground**: Lower friction (0.3) for different movement feel

### Solver Settings
- **Iterations**: 20 (higher for stability)
- **Tolerance**: 0.0001
- **Contact Stiffness**: 1e8 (balanced for stability)
- **Relaxation**: 3 (prevents excessive forces)

## Testing Results

✅ **Player Movement**: Smooth WASD movement with sprint
✅ **Jumping**: Space bar jumping with proper landing detection
✅ **Platform Standing**: No falling through geometry
✅ **Collision Response**: Proper wall/obstacle collision
✅ **Ground Detection**: Reliable contact-based detection
✅ **Animation Integration**: Idle/walk/jump animations work correctly

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Physics-Visual Separation**: Clean separation between Cannon.js physics and Three.js visuals
2. **Modular Design**: PhysicsWorld can be easily extended or replaced
3. **Material System**: Easy to add new material interactions
4. **Debug Integration**: Built-in visualization and debugging tools
5. **Performance**: Optimized for real-time gameplay

The collision system is now production-ready and provides a solid foundation for a 3D platformer game.
