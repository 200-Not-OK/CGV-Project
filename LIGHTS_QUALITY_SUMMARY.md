# All Lights - Quality System Summary

## ✅ Fully Quality-Aware Lights

### 🌿 CastleBioluminescentPlant (plantLights.js)
**What changes with quality:**

| Setting | LOW 🔴 | MEDIUM 🟡 | HIGH 🟢 |
|---------|--------|-----------|---------|
| Roots | 3 | 5 | 8 |
| Petals | 4 | 10 | 16 |
| Leaves | 6 | 14 | 24 |
| Moss Patches | 15 | 50 | 150 |
| Fireflies | **5** | **15** | **35** |
| Firefly Size | 20 | 28 | 35 |
| Geometry Detail | Simple (2x4 segments) | Complex (4x16) | Complex (4x16) |
| Shaders | Simple | Complex | Complex |

**Visual Impact:** 🔥🔥🔥 **EXTREME** - Most noticeable difference!

---

### 🔥 FlameParticles (flameParticles.js)
**What changes with quality:**

| Setting | LOW 🔴 | MEDIUM 🟡 | HIGH 🟢 |
|---------|--------|-----------|---------|
| Particle Count | **10** | **50** | **50** |
| Height Segments | 24 | 64 | 64 |
| Radial Segments | 16 | 36 | 36 |
| Geometry Complexity | ~384 verts | ~2,304 verts | ~2,304 verts |

**Geometry Reduction:** LOW has **5x fewer vertices** than HIGH!

**Visual Impact:** 🔥🔥 **HIGH** - Flames look simpler but still recognizable

---

### ⭐ StarLight (starLight.js)
**What changes with quality:**

| Setting | LOW 🔴 | MEDIUM 🟡 | HIGH 🟢 |
|---------|--------|-----------|---------|
| Light Intensity | 30 | 50 | 50 |
| Light Distance | 200 | 300 | 300 |
| Shadow Map Size | 128px | 256px | 256px |

**Visual Impact:** 🔥 **MODERATE** - Stars less bright on LOW, shorter range

---

### 💡 PointPulse (pointPulse.js)
**What changes with quality:**

| Setting | LOW 🔴 | MEDIUM 🟡 | HIGH 🟢 |
|---------|--------|-----------|---------|
| Intensity | 70% of normal | 100% | 100% |
| Distance | 70% of normal | 100% | 100% |

**Visual Impact:** 🔥 **LOW** - Subtle reduction in brightness

---

## ❌ Lights That Don't Need Quality Adjustment

### 🌅 BasicLights (basicLights.js)
- Just directional + ambient light
- No geometry or particles
- Already very performant
- **No changes needed**

### 🌤️ HemisphereFill (hemisphereFill.js)
- Simple hemisphere light
- No performance cost
- **No changes needed**

## Complete Quality Impact Summary

### When you press **Shift+1** (LOW Quality):

```
🌿 Plants:      5 fireflies, 6 leaves, 4 petals (sparse)
🔥 Flames:      10 particles, 384 vertices (simplified)
⭐ Stars:       30 intensity, 200 distance (dimmer)
💡 Point Lights: 70% brightness (slightly dimmer)
📊 Resolution:  75% render scale
```

### When you press **Shift+3** (HIGH Quality):

```
🌿 Plants:      35 fireflies, 24 leaves, 16 petals (lush!)
🔥 Flames:      50 particles, 2304 vertices (detailed)
⭐ Stars:       50 intensity, 300 distance (bright)
💡 Point Lights: 100% brightness (full)
📊 Resolution:  100-200% render scale
```
