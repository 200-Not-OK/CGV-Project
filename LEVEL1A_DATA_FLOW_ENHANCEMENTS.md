# Level 1A Data Flow Enhancement Summary

## ‚ú® What Was Added

Enhanced Level 1A with a **cyan-to-dark-blue** color scheme featuring **white data packets** continuously flowing through blue/cyan areas.

## üé® Color Scheme

- **Dark Blue Base**: `#001122` (near black, tech atmosphere)
- **Bright Cyan Accents**: `#00ccff` (data streams, glows, highlights)
- **White Data Packets**: `#ffffff` (bright white particles flowing through blue areas)

## üîß Technical Changes

### 1. **Atmosphere Lighting** (Updated)
- Ambient light changed to very dark blue (`#001122`) for a deeper tech atmosphere
- Key lights now use bright cyan (`#00ccff`) instead of lighter blue
- Added additional cyan fill lights for better coverage
- Rim lights updated to dark blue for depth

### 2. **Enhanced Data Flow Shader**
The data flow shader now:
- **Preserves existing textures** (70% original texture intensity, layered effect)
- **Detects blue/cyan areas** automatically (with lower threshold for better detection)
- **Creates gradient** from dark blue to bright cyan based on blue intensity
- **Animates white data packets** that continuously flow through blue stripes:
  - 4 overlapping data streams for continuous visual flow
  - Each packet has a trailing glow effect
  - Faster animation speed (2.0x) for dynamic feel
  - Wraps around seamlessly for infinite loop effect

### 3. **Shader Color Updates**
All shaders updated to match the cyan/dark blue theme:
- Server panels: Dark blue base with cyan scanning lines
- Tech tree: Dark blue base with cyan energy pulses
- Point lights: Updated to bright cyan
- All emissive materials: Cyan glow instead of previous colors

## üéØ How It Works

The data flow shader is applied as a **layered effect on top of existing materials**:

1. **Base Layer**: Original texture (preserved at 70% intensity)
2. **Gradient Layer**: Cyan-to-dark-blue gradient applied to blue areas
3. **Data Flow Layer**: White packets continuously moving through detected blue/cyan stripes
4. **Glow Layer**: Edge glows and rim lighting in cyan

## üìç What Gets Enhanced

The shader automatically detects and enhances:
- Meshes with names containing: `server`, `rack`, `panel`, `stripe`, `line`, `data`, `circuit`, `wire`, `led`, `horizontal`, `vertical`, `strip`, `bar`
- Any mesh with blue/cyan materials (detected automatically)
- Tech structures and tree meshes

## üéÆ Usage

The enhancements are **automatically applied** when Level 1A loads. The shader system:

- Detects blue/cyan areas in textures automatically
- Applies white data flow animations to detected areas
- Works alongside existing shading (additive effect, doesn't replace)
- Respects quality settings (adjusts intensity based on GPU tier)

## üîç Customization

If you want to adjust the effect, modify these uniforms in `_createDataFlowShader()`:

- `uFlowSpeed`: Speed of data packets (default: 2.0)
- `uFlowIntensity`: Brightness of white packets (default: 1.5x emissive intensity)
- `uBlueThreshold`: Sensitivity for detecting blue areas (default: 0.25)
- `uBaseTextureIntensity`: How much original texture shows through (default: 0.7)
- `uDataColor`: Color of flowing packets (currently white `#ffffff`)
- `uCyanColor`: Bright cyan for gradients (`#00ccff`)
- `uDarkBlueColor`: Dark blue base (`#001122`)

## üé¨ Visual Result

- **Dark tech atmosphere** with cyan accents
- **Continuous white data packets** flowing through all blue/cyan surfaces
- **Smooth gradient transitions** from dark blue (near black) to bright cyan
- **Layered effect** that preserves existing textures and shading
- **Dynamic animation** that makes the level feel alive with data flowing through it

## ‚ö° Performance

- Shader is GPU-optimized
- Respects quality settings (fewer effects on low-end GPUs)
- Uses efficient calculations (no expensive noise functions)
- Works well on both desktop GPUs and laptop iGPUs

---

**Result**: Level 1A now has a cohesive cyan-to-dark-blue tech aesthetic with animated white data streams flowing continuously through blue surfaces, creating a dynamic "data flowing" visual effect while preserving all existing shading!
