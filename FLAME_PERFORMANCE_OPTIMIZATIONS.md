# Flame Performance Optimizations

## Overview
The flame lighting system has been heavily optimized to improve frame rates while maintaining visual quality and dynamic shadow functionality. These optimizations focus on reducing GPU load, minimizing draw calls, and intelligently culling distant objects.

## Performance Improvements

### 1. **Reduced Shadow Casting** 
- **Max Shadow Casters**: 3 â†’ **2** flames
- **Update Interval**: 0.5s â†’ **1.0s** (50% fewer updates)
- **Distance Culling**: Only flames within **30 units** of player are considered for shadows
- **Result**: ~60% reduction in shadow calculations

### 2. **Optimized Shadow Quality** (Player-Focused)
- **Shadow Map Size**: 512x512 â†’ **256x256** (75% less memory)
- **Shadow Range**: 100 units â†’ **15 units** (focused on player)
- **Camera Near**: 0.5 â†’ **1.0** (better depth precision)
- **Shadow Bias**: -0.001 â†’ **-0.003** (softer, less intense shadows)
- **Shadow Radius**: 0 â†’ **2** (softer edges, more natural look)
- **Result**: Shadows are subtle, player-focused, and much cheaper to render

### 3. **Reduced Geometry Complexity**
- **Height Segments**: 64 â†’ **32** (50% fewer vertices)
- **Radial Segments**: 36 â†’ **18** (50% fewer vertices)
- **Total Vertex Reduction**: **~75% per flame**
- **Result**: Faster geometry processing, less GPU memory

### 4. **Reduced Particle Count**
- **Default Particles**: 50 â†’ **30** (40% fewer particles)
- **Existing Flames**: Already using 10 particles (good!)
- **Result**: Less computation for particle physics and rendering

### 5. **Intelligent Distance Culling**
```javascript
// Only flames within 30 units can have shadows
static maxShadowDistance = 30;

// Filters out distant flames before sorting
.filter(flame => flame.distanceToPlayer < FlameParticles.maxShadowDistance)
```
- **Result**: Flames in distant rooms don't participate in shadow calculations

## Visual Quality vs Performance

### What You Keep:
âœ… Volumetric flame effect (shaders unchanged)
âœ… Realistic flickering animation
âœ… Dynamic particle embers and sparks
âœ… Strong illumination (intensity 45, range 100)
âœ… Dynamic shadows that follow the player
âœ… Smooth transitions between shadow sources

### What Changed:
ðŸ”¹ Softer, more subtle shadows (less intense, more natural)
ðŸ”¹ Shorter shadow range (15 units - perfect for player)
ðŸ”¹ Lower resolution shadows (256x256 - still good quality)
ðŸ”¹ Only 2 closest flames cast shadows (instead of 3)
ðŸ”¹ Fewer geometry details (still looks great due to shaders)
ðŸ”¹ Slightly fewer particles (still maintains effect)

## Configuration Options

### Adjust Performance/Quality Balance

```javascript
// In flameParticles.js

// More shadows = better visuals, worse performance
FlameParticles.maxShadowCasters = 2; // Try 1 for max performance, 3 for quality

// Update frequency
FlameParticles.shadowUpdateInterval = 1.0; // Try 1.5 or 2.0 for better performance

// Distance culling
FlameParticles.maxShadowDistance = 30; // Increase to 40-50 for larger areas

// Shadow quality (per flame)
this.flameLight.shadow.mapSize.width = 256; // Try 128 for more FPS, 512 for quality
this.flameLight.shadow.camera.far = 15; // Increase to 20-25 for longer shadows
```

### Per-Flame Optimization

```javascript
// In levelData.js - for specific flames you can:
{
  key: "FlameParticles",
  props: {
    position: [x, y, z],
    particleCount: 5,  // Reduce for better performance (5-10 is good)
    height: 1.5,       // Smaller flames = better performance
    baseRadius: 0.2    // Smaller radius = better performance
  }
}
```

## Performance Metrics

### Before Optimizations:
- Shadow calculations: Every 0.5s for 3 flames
- Shadow map memory: 3 Ã— 512Â² = 786,432 pixels
- Geometry per flame: ~4,600 vertices
- Particles per flame: 50
- Total active calculations: All flames considered

### After Optimizations:
- Shadow calculations: Every 1.0s for 2 flames (within 30 units)
- Shadow map memory: 2 Ã— 256Â² = 131,072 pixels (**83% reduction**)
- Geometry per flame: ~1,150 vertices (**75% reduction**)
- Particles per flame: 30 (**40% reduction**)
- Total active calculations: Only nearby flames

### Expected Frame Rate Improvement:
- **GPU Load**: ~60-70% reduction in shadow rendering
- **CPU Load**: ~50% reduction in geometry/particle processing
- **Memory**: ~80% reduction in shadow map memory
- **Overall FPS**: Should see **2-3x improvement** in flame-heavy areas

## Technical Details

### Shadow System Flow
```
Every 1.0 second:
1. Calculate distance from player to all flames
2. Filter out flames > 30 units away
3. Sort remaining flames by distance
4. Disable all existing shadows
5. Enable shadows for 2 closest flames only
```

### Shadow Configuration
```javascript
Shadow Map: 256x256 (low resolution, soft shadows)
Near Plane: 1.0 (starts at player height)
Far Plane: 15 (extends to player vicinity)
Bias: -0.003 (prevents shadow acne, softer look)
Radius: 2 (PCF soft shadows)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Still experiencing low FPS?

1. **Reduce max shadow casters to 1**:
   ```javascript
   FlameParticles.maxShadowCasters = 1;
   ```

2. **Disable flame shadows entirely** (just use star shadows):
   ```javascript
   FlameParticles.maxShadowCasters = 0;
   ```

3. **Reduce particle count in levelData**:
   ```javascript
   particleCount: 5  // or even 0 to disable particles
   ```

4. **Increase shadow update interval**:
   ```javascript
   FlameParticles.shadowUpdateInterval = 2.0; // Update every 2 seconds
   ```

5. **Reduce flame count** in distant rooms that player rarely visits

## Room-Based Optimization (Future Enhancement)

For even better performance, you could implement room-based culling:

```javascript
// Pseudocode for future implementation
static updatePlayerPosition(playerPos, currentRoom) {
  // Only consider flames in current room + adjacent rooms
  const eligibleFlames = allFlameInstances.filter(flame => 
    flame.room === currentRoom || 
    adjacentRooms.includes(flame.room)
  );
  
  // Then apply distance sorting and shadow assignment
}
```

## Summary

These optimizations dramatically reduce the performance cost of dynamic flame shadows while maintaining a high-quality, player-focused lighting experience. The shadows are now subtle, natural-looking, and only appear where they matter most - around the player character.

**Key Takeaway**: With these changes, you should see a significant FPS improvement while still enjoying beautiful, dynamic flame lighting with realistic shadows following the player through the level! ðŸ”¥âœ¨
