# Cyan Lightning Effect - Physics-Based Implementation

## ⚡ What Makes This Different

**The Problem:** Previous version looked like random flickering instead of real lightning growing from nothing.

**The Solution:** Complete rewrite based on **actual lightning physics**:

1. ✅ **True Spatial Growth**: Bolt literally appears from nothing and extends through 3D space using shader clipping
2. ✅ **Fractal Path Generation**: Each strike uses DBM algorithm to create unique, realistic jagged patterns  
3. ✅ **Physics-Based Phases**: 
   - Dim "stepped leader" grows downward (establishes the path)
   - Bright "return stroke" flashes instantly (the lightning we see)
4. ✅ **No Fade Tricks**: Uses GLSL `discard` to clip geometry - bolt either exists or doesn't

**Visual Timeline (Per Bolt):**
```
t=0.0s   [ IDLE ]           Nothing visible
         ↓
t=0.0s   [ LEADER START ]   Bolt begins appearing at origin
         ↓
t=0.5s   ----               25% visible, dim red glow
         ↓
t=1.0s   --------           50% visible, branches appearing
         ↓
t=1.5s   ------------       75% visible, nearly complete
         ↓
t=2.0s   --------------     Full path visible, still dim
         ↓
t=2.3s   ⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡ BRIGHT FLASH! Return stroke!
         ↓
t=2.6s   -------------      Still bright, fading slowly
         ↓
t=3.0s   --------           Afterglow lingering
         ↓
t=3.1s   [ IDLE ]           Gone, waiting 2-5s for next strike
```

**With 10 Lightning Bolts:**
- Each bolt has different strike frequency (0.4-0.7)
- Staggered start times
- Total visible time per strike: ~3.1 seconds
- Idle between strikes: ~2-5 seconds
- **Result: CONTINUOUS LIGHTNING** - there's always at least 2-3 bolts active!

## Overview
A **physically accurate** red lightning effect based on real lightning physics and the Dielectric Breakdown Model (DBM). This implementation simulates actual lightning behavior including stepped leader propagation and return stroke physics.

## Features

### Realistic Lightning Physics
Based on scientific research of how lightning actually forms and strikes:

#### Real Lightning Process:
1. **Stepped Leader** (~20ms in reality, ~600ms for visibility): A dim channel propagates downward from cloud in discrete steps, ionizing air molecules
2. **Return Stroke** (~70 microseconds): Once the path is established, a brilliant flash travels UP the channel - this is what we see as lightning
3. **Afterglow** (~100ms): Brief dissipation of the plasma channel

#### Our Implementation:
- **Fractal Path Generation**: Uses modified DBM algorithm to create realistic branching patterns
- **Shader-Based Growth**: The bolt **literally grows through space** using GLSL clipping - not fading
- **Progressive Revelation**: Shader clips pixels beyond growth progress, making bolt extend from origin
- **Physics-Accurate Timing**: Stepped leader is dim and slow, return stroke is bright and instant

### Visual Effects
- **Procedural Lightning Path**: Each strike generates unique jagged, branching patterns
- **True Spatial Growth**: Bolt appears from nothing and extends through 3D space
- **Stepped Leader Phase**: Dim, growing bolt that establishes the path
- **Return Stroke Flash**: Sudden, intense brightness (~3-4x brighter than leader)
- **Fractal Branching**: Secondary branches appear as main bolt grows past their origin points
- **Cyan/Blue Color Gradient**: Hot white core → cyan → deep blue → dark blue edges
- **Volumetric Glow**: Energy sphere at strike origin
- **Phase-Based Lighting**: Dynamic point light synchronized with physics

### The Four Phases

1. **Idle Phase** (Variable): Completely invisible, waiting for next strike event

2. **Leader Phase** (~2.0s): **THE GROWTH PHASE**
   - Bolt **literally appears from nothing** and extends downward SLOWLY
   - Uses shader clipping to progressively reveal geometry from top to bottom
   - Dim intensity (~30% brightness) - simulates ionized channel formation
   - Branches appear as main bolt grows past their attachment points
   - Long, dramatic buildup - you can watch the lightning form
   - Creates anticipation and shows the path forming

3. **Return Stroke** (~0.3s): **THE STRIKE**
   - Sudden **MASSIVE FLASH** at full intensity
   - The bolt is now fully visible and BRIGHT
   - Flash lasts long enough to see clearly (not just a blink)
   - This is what we perceive as "the lightning"
   - Light intensity jumps to 300x base value
   - Dramatic and highly visible

4. **Fading Phase** (~0.8s): Afterglow lingers
   - Bolt remains visible but gradually dims
   - Long afterglow creates dramatic effect
   - Plasma channel slowly cools and disappears
   - Gives you time to appreciate the lightning before it vanishes

### Shader-Based Rendering

#### **Critical Innovation: Spatial Clipping for Growth**
The shader uses a `growthProgress` uniform (0 to 1) combined with vertex UV coordinates to clip the bolt:

```glsl
// In fragment shader:
if (vProgress > growthProgress) {
    discard; // Don't render this pixel
}
```

This makes the bolt **literally grow through space** by revealing it from top (progress=0) to bottom (progress=1). Each pixel is either visible or completely discarded - no fading tricks.

#### Other Shader Features:
- **Electric Noise**: High-frequency noise patterns simulate electric arcing
- **Color Gradient**: Hot core (bright red) to cool edges (dark red)
- **Dual Intensity**: Different brightness for leader (dim) vs return stroke (bright)
- **Additive Blending**: Realistic light emission and glow
- **Temporal Animation**: Electric patterns shimmer and move

### Dynamic Lighting
- **Point Light**: Intense red light synchronized with lightning phases
- **Phase-Aware Intensity**: 
  - Subtle glow during building (20x)
  - Building intensity during charging (50x)
  - Massive flash during strike (200x)
  - Quick fade during disappearance (100x)
- **Position Jitter**: Light position jitters during strike for extra realism

## Implementation

### File Structure
```
src/game/lights/
├── lightning.js          # New: RedLightning component
└── index.js             # Updated: Exports RedLightning
```

### Component: RedLightning

Located in: `src/game/lights/lightning.js`

#### Properties

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `position` | Array[3] | [0, 0, 0] | Lightning origin point [x, y, z] |
| `color` | Hex | 0xFF0000 | Lightning color (red by default) |
| `intensity` | Number | 3.0 | Visual brightness multiplier |
| `strikeFrequency` | Number | 0.3 | How often lightning strikes (0-1, higher = more frequent) |
| `length` | Number | 5.0 | Length of the main bolt (downward) |
| `branches` | Number | 3 | Number of branch bolts |

#### How It Actually Works

**1. Path Generation (on mount):**
```javascript
// Modified DBM (Dielectric Breakdown Model)
- Generate 32 step points from origin downward
- Each step has random lateral deviation (jitter)
- Add coherent noise for natural curves
- Create 3 branch paths at random attachment points
```

**2. Visual Growth (leader phase):**
```javascript
// growthProgress goes from 0.0 → 1.0
0.00: Bolt completely invisible (clipped)
0.25: First 25% of bolt visible, extending downward
0.50: Halfway there, branches starting to appear
0.75: Nearly complete path visible
1.00: Full bolt path revealed
```

**3. Return Stroke (flash):**
```javascript
// strikeIntensity jumps to 1.0
- Full bolt now visible
- Brightness multiplied by 3-4x
- Light intensity: 300x base value
- BRIGHT, dramatic flash
```

**4. Disappearance:**
```javascript
// strikeIntensity fades 1.0 → 0.0
- Bolt still fully grown but dimming
- Quick fade over 150ms
- Returns to invisible state
```

**The Key Difference:**
- ❌ **Old way**: Fade in → flash → fade out (looks like flickering)
- ✅ **New way**: Appear from nothing → grow through space → flash bright → disappear (looks like real lightning)

#### Usage in Level Data

The lightning has been added to **level1A** at 10 strategic positions:

```json
{
  "key": "RedLightning",
  "props": {
    "position": [12.912955239766767, 37.88715128438456, -0.6576220834419964],
    "color": 0xFF0000,
    "intensity": 3.0,
    "strikeFrequency": 0.3,
    "length": 5.0,
    "branches": 3
  }
}
```

### Installed Locations (Level 1A)

| # | Position | Strike Freq | Intensity |
|---|----------|-------------|-----------|
| 1 | [12.91, 37.89, -0.66] | 0.50 | 3.5 |
| 2 | [12.94, 36.39, -0.73] | 0.60 | 3.5 |
| 3 | [-12.77, 37.11, -0.28] | 0.45 | 3.5 |
| 4 | [-12.79, 35.64, 0.10] | 0.55 | 3.5 |
| 5 | [11.92, 32.83, -0.58] | 0.70 | 3.5 |
| 6 | [-12.38, 32.99, 0.30] | 0.40 | 3.5 |
| 7 | [-7.07, 39.09, -1.20] | 0.65 | 3.5 |
| 8 | [-7.65, 39.12, 0.70] | 0.52 | 3.5 |
| 9 | [7.06, 38.90, -1.47] | 0.48 | 3.5 |
| 10 | [6.63, 38.87, 1.32] | 0.58 | 3.5 |

**Strike frequencies range from 0.40 to 0.70** - this creates overlapping cycles so there's **always lightning active**!

**Timing breakdown per bolt:**
- Visible time: ~3.1 seconds (growth + flash + fade)
- Idle time: ~2-5 seconds (depending on frequency)
- Total cycle: ~5-8 seconds

**With 10 bolts staggered:** At any given moment, you'll see 2-4 bolts in various stages (growing, flashing, or fading)!

### How Continuous Activity Works

**The Math:**
- Each bolt is visible for: 2.0s (leader) + 0.3s (return) + 0.8s (fade) = **3.1 seconds**
- Each bolt is idle for: 2.0 / strikeFrequency ± variation = **~2.8-7.1 seconds**
- Total cycle per bolt: **~5.9-10.2 seconds**

**With 10 Bolts:**
- Average cycle time: ~8 seconds per bolt
- 10 bolts × 3.1s visible / 8s cycle = **~38.75% coverage per bolt**
- 10 bolts × 38.75% = **387.5% total coverage**
- This means **3-4 bolts are ALWAYS visible** at any moment!

**Staggering Strategy:**
- Random initial delays (0-2 seconds)
- Strike frequencies from 0.40 to 0.70 (spread out)
- Random variation in idle timing (±30%)
- Result: **Continuous, chaotic lightning storm effect!**

## Customization

### Current Color: Electric Cyan

The lightning uses a **4-tier color gradient** for maximum realism:
- **Core:** Pure white (0xFFFFFF) - hottest point
- **Mid-1:** Bright cyan (0x00FFFF) - electric blue
- **Mid-2:** Deep blue (0x0088FF) - rich electric
- **Edges:** Dark blue (0x0044AA) - atmospheric fade

**Size & Visual Enhancements:**
- Main bolt: 0.35 radius (2.3x bigger than original)
- Branches: 0.20 radius (2.5x bigger)
- Glow: 1.2 radius (2x bigger)
- Fractal noise shader for realistic electric texture
- Animated arcing patterns
- Enhanced bloom during strikes

### Changing Colors

You can customize the lightning by editing the shader uniforms in `lightning.js`:

```javascript
// Purple lightning
color1: 0xFFFFFF,  // White core
color2: 0xFF00FF,  // Magenta
color3: 0x9900FF,  // Purple
color4: 0x4400AA   // Dark purple

// Green lightning  
color1: 0xFFFFFF,  // White core
color2: 0x00FFAA,  // Bright cyan-green
color3: 0x00FF00,  // Pure green
color4: 0x00AA00   // Dark green

// Orange/Fire lightning
color1: 0xFFFFFF,  // White core
color2: 0xFFAA00,  // Orange
color3: 0xFF6600,  // Deep orange
color4: 0xAA3300   // Red-orange
```

Or just change the `color` property in level data (will use as the point light color):
```javascript
"color": 0xFF00FF  // Purple light
```

### Adjusting Strike Behavior

```javascript
// More frequent strikes (stormy)
strikeFrequency: 0.8

// Rare strikes (ominous)
strikeFrequency: 0.1

// Longer bolts
length: 10.0

// More dramatic branching
branches: 5
```

### Performance Considerations

The RedLightning effect is moderately GPU-intensive due to:
- Custom shader materials
- Particle systems
- Dynamic geometry generation
- Real-time lighting

**Optimization tips:**
- Reduce `branches` count for lower-end systems
- Lower `strikeFrequency` to reduce overhead
- Disable casting shadows on point lights (already done by default)

## Technical Details

### Path Generation Algorithm

**Modified DBM (Dielectric Breakdown Model):**
```javascript
1. Start at origin point
2. For each of 32 steps:
   - Move downward by stepSize
   - Add random lateral deviation (jaggedness)
   - Add Perlin-like coherent noise
   - Store position in path array
3. Generate 3 branch paths:
   - Attach at random points along main path
   - Branch at angle with smaller segments
   - Store attachment progress for timing
```

This creates the characteristic **fractal, jagged pattern** of real lightning.

### Shader Implementation

**Key Uniforms:**
- `growthProgress` (0-1): How far the leader has propagated
- `strikeIntensity` (0-1): Brightness of return stroke
- `leaderIntensity` (0.3): Dim brightness of stepped leader

**Vertex Shader:**
- Passes `vProgress = uv.y` to fragment shader
- Each vertex knows its position along the bolt (0=top, 1=bottom)

**Fragment Shader:**
```glsl
// THE MAGIC: Spatial clipping
if (vProgress > growthProgress) {
    discard; // Clip everything beyond growth
}

// Dual-phase brightness
float brightness = mix(leaderIntensity, 1.0, strikeIntensity);

// Leader = dim (30%), Return stroke = bright (100%)
```

### Geometry

- **TubeGeometry** along **CatmullRomCurve3** path
- Main bolt: 64 segments, 0.15 radius
- Branches: 32 segments, 0.08 radius
- Pre-generated but progressively revealed by shader

## Troubleshooting

### Lightning not appearing
- Check that `RedLightning` is exported in `src/game/lights/index.js`
- Verify the position is within the camera's view frustum
- Check console for any error messages
- Look for console logs: "⚡ Lightning building..." and "⚡ STRIKE!"
- Wait for the full cycle - bolt may be in idle phase (invisible)

### Lightning too dim
- Increase `intensity` property (default: 3.0, try 5.0+)
- Check quality settings aren't limiting shader complexity
- Ensure additive blending is working (check WebGL support)
- Lightning is very bright during strike phase, dim during build - this is intentional

### Lightning strikes too often/rarely
- Adjust `strikeFrequency` (0.1 = rare, 0.8 = frequent)
- Each visible strike cycle lasts ~1.3 seconds
- Idle time between strikes: ~(3.0 / strikeFrequency) seconds
- Total time between strikes: ~1.3s + (3.0 / strikeFrequency)s

### Lightning grows but doesn't strike
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify all phases are transitioning correctly
- Look for phase transition logs in console

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:
- Sound effects synchronized with strikes
- Environment interaction (briefly illuminate nearby objects)
- Strike-to-ground raycast for more realistic targeting
- Ambient glow fade-in before strikes (warning effect)
- Thunder rumble delay based on distance
