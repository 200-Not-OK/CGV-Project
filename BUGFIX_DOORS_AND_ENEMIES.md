# Bug Fixes - Doors and Enemy System

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Level.js - Enemy Manager Null Reference Error
**Error:** `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'enemies')` at level.js:403

**Cause:** The `getEnemies()` method was trying to access `this.enemyManager.enemies` without checking if `enemyManager` was initialized.

**Fix:**
```javascript
// Before (caused crash)
getEnemies() {
  return this.enemyManager.enemies;
}

// After (safe with null check)
getEnemies() {
  return this.enemyManager ? this.enemyManager.enemies : [];
}
```

**Impact:** 
- Prevents crashes when levels don't have enemies
- Returns empty array instead of crashing
- Game continues to function normally

### 2. DoorBase.js - Missing Physics Method Error
**Error:** `this.physicsWorld.createDoorBody is not a function` at DoorBase.js:665

**Cause:** The door system was calling a non-existent `createDoorBody()` method on the PhysicsWorld.

**Fix:**
```javascript
// Before (non-existent method)
this.body = this.physicsWorld.createDoorBody(collisionCenter, collisionSize);

// After (proper method with correct configuration)
this.body = this.physicsWorld.createDynamicBody({
  mass: 0, // Kinematic body (not affected by gravity)
  shape: 'box',
  size: collisionSize,
  position: [collisionCenter.x, collisionCenter.y, collisionCenter.z],
  material: 'wall'
});

// Set as kinematic (controlled by animation, not physics)
this.body.type = CANNON.Body.KINEMATIC;
this.body.collisionResponse = true; // Blocks the player
```

**Impact:**
- Doors now have proper physics bodies
- Doors block player movement correctly
- Doors are controlled by animation, not gravity
- Eliminates infinite error loop in console

---

## Technical Details

### Kinematic Body Configuration
Doors use a **kinematic body** instead of dynamic or static:

- **Mass = 0**: Not affected by gravity or forces
- **KINEMATIC Type**: Position controlled by code/animation
- **Collision Response = true**: Still blocks other objects
- **Wall Material**: Uses proper collision material

This is perfect for animated doors because:
1. âœ… Door position controlled by animation system
2. âœ… Still blocks player and enemies
3. âœ… Doesn't fall or get pushed by physics forces
4. âœ… Can be moved smoothly by code

### Enemy Manager Safety
The null check ensures:
1. âœ… Works with levels that have no enemies
2. âœ… Works during level loading/unloading
3. âœ… Returns empty array instead of crashing
4. âœ… Combat system handles empty arrays gracefully

## Testing Checklist

- [x] No console errors on level load
- [x] Doors have physics bodies
- [x] Doors block player movement
- [x] Levels without enemies don't crash
- [x] Combat system works with empty enemy arrays
- [x] Door animations play smoothly

---

## Result
Both critical errors are now resolved. The game runs without errors, doors have proper physics, and the enemy system gracefully handles levels with or without enemies. ðŸŽ®âœ…
