# Mech Boss Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully created a new **MechBossEnemy** class with static behavior that activates when the player comes into view. The mech boss uses two animations from the robot model: MSA_Anim_1 (walk) and MSA_Anim_3 (attack).

## Key Features

### ü§ñ Mech Boss Characteristics
- **Health**: 600 HP (very tanky boss)
- **Default State**: Completely static/idle until player detected
- **Detection Range**: 15 units
- **Chase Speed**: 2.0 (moderate when active)
- **Attack Range**: 3.0 units
- **Attack Damage**: 25 (normal), 35 (enraged)
- **Attack Cooldown**: 4 seconds
- **Grace Period**: 1 second warning before first attack

### üéÆ Behavior System

#### States:
1. **Idle (Default)**: Mech remains completely static, no movement
2. **Chase**: Activated when player enters detection range (15 units)
3. **Pre-Attack**: 1 second grace period warning before attack
4. **Attack**: Executes attack animation and damage
5. **Enraged**: Activates at 25% health - increased speed and faster attacks

#### Movement:
- **Static by default** - no patrol behavior
- Only moves when player is detected within range
- Heavy, deliberate movement (mass: 8.0, high damping)
- Returns to idle/static state if player escapes

### üé¨ Animation System

The boss uses two specific animations from the model:
- **MSA_Anim_1**: Walk cycle (used for movement and idle)
- **MSA_Anim_3**: Attack cycle (used during attack sequences)

Auto-detection system maps these animations:
```javascript
'MSA_Anim_1' ‚Üí walk animation
'MSA_Anim_3' ‚Üí attack animation
```

### ‚öîÔ∏è Combat Mechanics

- **Grace Period**: 1 second warning before first attack (disabled after first hit)
- **Attack Cooldown**: 4 seconds (3 seconds when enraged)
- **Enrage Mode**: At 25% health
  - +30% speed
  - +20% chase speed
  - 25% faster attacks
  - Can chain 2 attacks consecutively
  - Health bar turns red

### üéØ Boss-Specific Features

- **Large Health Bar**: Always visible orange health bar (2.5x0.3 size)
- **Heavy Physics**: Mass 8.0, high friction, no bounce
- **Large Collider**: 4x4x4 collision box for boss presence
- **Boss Events**: Fires `boss:defeated` and `level:complete` events on death
- **Single Defeat Signal**: `_deathEventFired` flag prevents duplicate events

## Files Modified/Created

### ‚úÖ Created:
1. **`src/game/enemies/MechBossEnemy.js`** - Main mech boss class (550+ lines)

### ‚úÖ Modified:
1. **`src/game/enemies/index.js`** - Added MechBossEnemy export
2. **`src/game/EnemyManager.js`** - Registered `mech_boss` type in typeRegistry
3. **`src/editor/StandaloneLevelEditor.js`** - Added mech_boss to:
   - Enemy types array
   - Default model URL mapping
   - Default speed configuration

## Usage in Level Editor

### Adding Mech Boss:
1. Open Level Editor (`localhost:5173/editor.html`)
2. Switch to **Enemy Mode**
3. Select **mech_boss** from dropdown
4. Click to place in level
5. Configure properties:
   - Position
   - Chase Range (detection range)
   - Patrol Points (optional, but boss is static by default)
   - Speed
   - Scale

### Example Level Data Entry:
```javascript
{
  type: 'mech_boss',
  position: [0, 2, -20],
  modelUrl: 'src/assets/enemies/robot_boss/scene.gltf',
  patrolPoints: [], // Empty - mech is static
  speed: 1.5,
  chaseRange: 15.0, // Detection range
  id: 42
}
```

## Technical Details

### Model Loading:
- Asset location: `src/assets/enemies/robot_boss/scene.gltf`
- Auto-scaled 2x larger than base model
- Centered on physics body
- Animations auto-mapped by name

### Physics Configuration:
```javascript
mass: 8.0              // Very heavy
linearDamping: 0.6     // Slow, deliberate movement
friction: 0.8          // Good ground contact
restitution: 0.0       // No bounce
colliderOffset: 2.0    // Vertical alignment
```

### AI Update Pattern:
1. Check distance to player
2. Update behavior state
3. Execute state-specific logic
4. Update animations based on state
5. Sync mesh to physics body

## Comparison with Snake Boss

| Feature | Snake Boss | Mech Boss |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Health | 500 HP | 600 HP |
| Default State | Patrol | **Static/Idle** |
| Movement | Agile | Heavy/Deliberate |
| Attack Range | 2.5 | 3.0 |
| Detection | 12.0 | 15.0 |
| Enrage Threshold | 30% | 25% |
| Visual Style | Organic | Mechanical |
| Mass | 5.0 | 8.0 |

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Mech spawns in level correctly
- [ ] Remains static until player approaches
- [ ] Activates and chases when player in range
- [ ] Attack animations play correctly
- [ ] Damage is dealt to player
- [ ] Grace period warning works
- [ ] Enrage mode activates at 25% health
- [ ] Health bar always visible and updates
- [ ] Boss defeat events fire correctly
- [ ] Returns to idle if player escapes
- [ ] Editor can place and configure mech boss

## Future Enhancement Ideas

- Add ground slam attack
- Add laser beam ranged attack
- Add particle effects for activation
- Add audio cues for state changes
- Add shield mechanic at 50% health
- Add multiple attack patterns based on distance
